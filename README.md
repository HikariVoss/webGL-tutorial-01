# webGL-tutorial-01
First webGL tutorial

Tutorial: drawing a triangle to an HTML canvas

I followed the tutorial however I ran into some errors which I can not yet resolve.
The errors which I could not resolve are: 
```
index.js:45 WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: useProgram: program not valid
index.js:46 WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: getUniformLocation: program not linked
index.js:49 WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: getAttribLocation: program not linked
index.js:53 WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: drawArrays: no valid shader program in use
```
